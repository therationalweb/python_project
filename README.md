# python_project
This repository contains the code I created as a proof of concept using Python and Flask. It generates a simple web page that represents the backoffice functions for a hypothetical book store named A to Z Books. Only the inventory and purchase sides are represented. I will add the sales side too, so that I can demonstrate graphing and dynamically update the number of books available.

-- If you have suggestions, please let me know! This was my first attempt at a Python project and I am very much a noob :)
